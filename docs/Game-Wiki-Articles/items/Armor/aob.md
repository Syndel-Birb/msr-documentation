Armour of Bravery is the only one of only two items in the game that can negate xp death penalty, the other being the Potion of Bravery. The downside of this armour is it's comparatively low damage resistance and lack of elemental resistance when compared to other armours with similar requirements.

# note, I can't actually work out how the armour of bravery is actually supposed to prevent the death penalty from looking at the armor_belmont script. The Potion of Bravery uses the setvard PLR_BRAVERY but this isn't triggered in armor_belmont.
